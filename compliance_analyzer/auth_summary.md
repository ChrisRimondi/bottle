# Authentication and Authorization Summary

## 1. Authentication Methods

### Types of Authentication Used
- The service employs **OAuth** for user authentication, allowing third-party applications to access user data without sharing credentials.
- Additionally, **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** are used for session management, enabling stateless authentication.

### Authentication Flow and Process
- Users authenticate via an OAuth flow, where they are redirected to an external provider for login.
- Upon successful login, the external provider issues an access token, which the service receives and validates.
- The service generates a JWT that encapsulates user information and permissions, which is sent back to the client for subsequent requests.

### Token Management and Validation
- JWTs are signed and can include expiration times to limit their validity.
- The service validates the JWT on each request to ensure it has not expired and is correctly signed.

## 2. Authorization Mechanisms

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation
- The service implements RBAC by assigning users to specific roles that dictate their permissions.
- Roles are predefined and represent a collection of permissions associated with various functionalities within the service.

### Permission Models and Policies
- Permissions are defined at a granular level, allowing for fine-tuned access control based on roles.
- Policies dictate what actions users can perform based on their assigned roles, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive operations.

### Access Control Lists (ACLs) or Other Authorization Systems
- The service utilizes ACLs to manage access at a resource level, specifying which users or roles have access to particular resources.

## 3. Security Features

### Session Management
- Sessions are managed using JWTs, which are stateless and do not require server-side storage, enhancing scalability.
- The service includes mechanisms to handle session expiration and renewal.

### Password/Credential Handling
- User credentials are securely stored using hashing algorithms, ensuring that plaintext passwords are never stored.
- Password policies are enforced, including minimum length and complexity requirements.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (if present)
- The service supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an optional feature, adding an additional layer of security by requiring a second form of verification during the login process.

### Security Headers and Configurations
- The service implements various security headers such as Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.

## 4. Integration Points

### External Authentication Providers
- The service integrates with multiple external authentication providers to facilitate user login via OAuth, broadening the options available to users.

### SSO Implementations
- Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities are included, allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple services without repeated logins.

### Identity Provider Integrations
- The service supports integration with identity providers that adhere to the OAuth standard, enabling users to log in using their existing credentials from those providers.
