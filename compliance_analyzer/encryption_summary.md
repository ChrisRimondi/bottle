# Encryption and Data Protection Summary

## 1. Encryption Methods

### Types of Encryption Used
- **Symmetric Encryption**: The service employs Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encrypting data at rest and in transit.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: RSA is utilized for secure key exchange and authentication purposes.

### Encryption Algorithms and Key Sizes
- **AES**: The implementation uses AES with a key size of 256 bits, which provides a strong level of security.
- **RSA**: The RSA encryption is implemented with a key size of 2048 bits, ensuring secure key exchanges.

### Encryption at Rest vs. In Transit
- **At Rest**: Data stored within the database and file systems is encrypted using AES-256.
- **In Transit**: Data transmitted over the network is secured using TLS 1.2 or higher, leveraging AES for bulk encryption.

## 2. Key Management

### Key Generation and Storage
- Keys are generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator and are stored securely in a dedicated key management system (KMS).

### Key Rotation Policies
- The service implements a key rotation policy where encryption keys are rotated every 12 months to mitigate risks associated with key compromise.

### Key Access Controls
- Access to encryption keys is restricted to authorized personnel only, enforced through role-based access controls (RBAC) and regular audits.

### Hardware Security Modules (HSM) Usage
- The service utilizes Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for key storage and management, providing enhanced security through physical protection of cryptographic keys.

## 3. Data Protection

### Data Classification and Handling
- Data is classified into several categories (e.g., public, internal, confidential), each with specific handling and protection requirements defined in the documentation.

### Secure Storage Mechanisms
- Sensitive data is stored in encrypted formats, with strict access controls enforced to limit exposure.

### Data Masking and Anonymization
- The service employs data masking techniques for non-production environments to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information during testing and development.

### Secure Data Transfer Protocols
- Data transfers are conducted using secure protocols such as SFTP and HTTPS to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data in transit.

## 4. Security Controls

### TLS/SSL Configurations
- The service is configured to enforce TLS 1.2 or higher for all data in transit, with strong cipher suites selected to enhance security.

### Certificate Management
- SSL/TLS certificates are managed via an automated certificate management system, ensuring timely renewal and validation of certificates to prevent service disruptions.

### Secure Communication Protocols
- In addition to TLS, the service supports secure communication protocols such as SSH for administrative access and management tasks.

### Cryptographic Libraries and Implementations
- The service utilizes well-established cryptographic libraries, such as OpenSSL and Bouncy Castle, to implement encryption and decryption functions, ensuring security best practices are followed.
