# Summary of Encryption and Data Protection Mechanisms

## 1. Encryption Methods

- **Types of Encryption Used**:
  - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is utilized for symmetric encryption.
  - RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is employed for asymmetric encryption.

- **Encryption Algorithms and Key Sizes**:
  - AES is configured with a key size of 256 bits.
  - RSA keys are generated with a size of 2048 bits.

- **Encryption at Rest vs. In Transit**:
  - Data at rest is encrypted using AES-256.
  - Data in transit is protected using TLS (Transport Layer Security) to ensure secure communication.

## 2. Key Management

- **Key Generation and Storage**:
  - Keys are generated using a secure random number generator and stored in a secure key management system.

- **Key Rotation Policies**:
  - Regular key rotation policies are implemented to mitigate risks associated with key compromise.

- **Key Access Controls**:
  - Access to encryption keys is restricted based on roles and responsibilities within the organization.

- **Hardware Security Modules (HSM) Usage**:
  - HSMs are employed to provide a secure environment for key management and cryptographic operations.

## 3. Data Protection

- **Data Classification and Handling**:
  - Data is classified into different sensitivity levels, and handling procedures are defined according to these levels.

- **Secure Storage Mechanisms**:
  - Encrypted file systems are used to store sensitive data securely.

- **Data Masking and Anonymization**:
  - Data masking techniques are applied to protect sensitive information in non-production environments.

- **Secure Data Transfer Protocols**:
  - Data transfer is secured using protocols such as SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure).

## 4. Security Controls

- **TLS/SSL Configurations**:
  - TLS configurations are set to use the latest version, ensuring strong encryption settings and cipher suites.

- **Certificate Management**:
  - SSL/TLS certificates are managed with a renewal process in place to prevent expiration.

- **Secure Communication Protocols**:
  - Communication between services is conducted over secured protocols like HTTPS and SFTP.

- **Cryptographic Libraries and Implementations**:
  - Established cryptographic libraries are used for implementing encryption and decryption functions, ensuring compliance with industry standards.
